## Milestone 5
The assignment instructions can be found [here](http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/t3/M5.html).

## Class project retrospective
For our project retrospective we were asked to complete the following:
### Safety Check
We unanomously desided to forgoe the safety check after we all started laughing about safety checks.

### What did you learn?
"Pay closer attention to merge conflicts and how to solve them."
"Front-end skills suck."
"MVVM!"
"Triple-composite keys are annoying."

### What still puzzles you?
"Why did we have a triple-composite key in the first place?"

### What can the team do better during the next Sprint?
Action Plan:
Make an itinerary for our planning meetings
Working on one thing at a time as a group
Make a development database on Azure
If you delete files out of VS, do it in VS, not from the file viewer
Use third-party libraries, check with everyone

### Are there any items that need to be brought up with someone outside the team? (i.e. in this case the instructor)
Nope

## Team project inception
We updated our architecture diagram to include the web service and specify the mobile clients.
We updated our needs and requirements to include our Rest API.
We also needed to update our ER diagram. Here is the updated diagram:

We were also asked to make a welcome page on our repository for the project. You can see that [here]().

## Team project construction begins
The group met for a backlog refinement meeting and updated our Product Backlog Items. We broke them down into tasks and after that we  assigned them to individuals and committed them to Sprint 1 of our group project.
