      <h2 id="BoldB">Homework 1</h2>
      <p> The first homework assignment tasked us with learning the basics of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Git.
        The assignment instructions can be found <a href="http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW1.html">here</a>.
        Essentially we have been asked to build a set of web pages.
      </p>

      <p> The first step was downloading Git, and making accounts on both GitHub and BitBucket.Once that was done I created a repo on GitHub
        and cloned a copy to my machine. From there I created a folder of a few html files and pushed that to the remote server.
      </p>


      <div><pre class="highlight">
      <code><span>
        git add -A
        git commit -m "first commit"
        git push origin master
    </span></code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>From there it was simply a matter of puting together a few more html files to complete the set of web pages and making sure they matched the assignments specifications.</p>
      <p>Once the pages were complete I pushed them to my remote repo and began working on the pages for this portfolio</p>
      <p>After they were complete I pushed them as well and made sure everything liked correctly.</p>
