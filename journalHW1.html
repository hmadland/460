      <h2 id="BoldB">Homework 1</h2>
      <p> The first homework assignment tasked us with learning the basics of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Git.
        The assignment instructions can be found <a href="http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW1.html">here</a>.
        Essentially we have been asked to build a set of web pages.
      </p>

      <p> The first step was downloading Git, and making accounts on both GitHub and BitBucket.Once that was done I created a repo on GitHub
        and cloned a copy to my machine. From there I created a folder of a few html files and pushed that to the remote server.
